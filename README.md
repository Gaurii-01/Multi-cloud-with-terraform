# Multi-Cloud Terraform Automation with PowerShell

### Introduction
Modern organizations increasingly rely on multi-cloud strategies to enhance flexibility, avoid vendor lock-in, and optimize performance and cost. However, managing infrastructure across multiple cloud providers can be complex.

This project aims to automate the provisioning of virtual machines (VMs) on AWS, GCP, and Azure using a unified PowerShell script and modular Terraform configuration, enabling seamless, repeatable, and user-friendly deployment.

### Objectives
Automate VM provisioning across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

Enable users to select the cloud provider interactively.

Use a single script to dynamically execute Terraform workflows.

Maintain modularity using per-provider directories.

Ensure repeatable infrastructure deployments and clean teardowns.
